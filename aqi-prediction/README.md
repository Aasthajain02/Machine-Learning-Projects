Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction and Analysis

This project aims to analyze air quality data from India and develop a model to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI). AQI is a standardized measure that reflects the overall air pollution level, providing valuable information for public health and environmental decision-making.

Data Acquisition:

The project leverages the "India Air Quality Data" dataset downloaded from Kaggle.
Data Exploration and Preprocessing:

We'll delve into the data to understand its structure, identify missing values, and perform necessary cleaning techniques like imputation.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) will be conducted using visualization tools like seaborn and matplotlib to uncover relationships between features and AQI.
Feature Engineering (Optional):

Depending on the dataset's nature, we might create additional features that could influence AQI, such as extracting date-time information (month, season) or calculating pollutant ratios.
AQI Calculation:

We'll implement the provided formula to calculate the Individual Pollutant Index (IPI) for various pollutants like SO2, NO2, RSPM, and SPM.
The overall AQI will be determined by finding the maximum IPI value for each data point.
Machine Learning Model Development (Next Steps):

The preprocessed data (including the calculated AQI as the target variable) will be used to train and evaluate different machine learning models. Candidate models might include:
Linear Regression: A good baseline for understanding the linear relationship between features and AQI.
Decision Tree Regressor: Captures non-linear relationships but can be prone to overfitting.
Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble method that combines decision trees for improved accuracy and robustness.
Model Evaluation:

The performance of trained models will be evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²). These metrics will assess the accuracy, generalizability, and fit of each model.
Project Outcomes:

This project will provide insights into air quality patterns in India based on the data analysis.
The developed AQI prediction model, if successful, could be used to predict future AQI based on real-time or historical data, empowering stakeholders to take preventive measures and mitigate air pollution's impact.
